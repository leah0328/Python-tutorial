#List

# When creating list, use []
# Values can be either string, integer, boolean

random_stuff = ["Ken",8,True]
print(random_stuff)

# Use index to access a particular values
# Remember index always start from 0

friend=["Robin","Barney","Marshal", "Lily","Ted"]
print(friend[0])

# values can also be access from the back of the list
# so it starts from -1, -2, -3

print(friend[-3])

# can also specify a range of value with [x:y]
# so it will show value from x up to y, 
# but not including y itself

print(friend[1:-2])

# Use index to modify a certain velues inside of lists
print(friend[-1])= "Ted sucks"
